## [1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subarray-of-1s-after-deleting-one-element/)

Great question on variable length sliding window
Logic:
1. `l` keeps track of left side of sliding window. `r` keeps track of right
2. if value at `r` is 0, increment count of 0s (`count`)
3. if count>1, then move `l` forward until only one zero between `l` and `r`
4. the result value is computed as `r-l+1-count`
		i. the difference between  `r` and `l` -> includes all elements between both
		ii. remove the count of zeros between `r` and `l`
		
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int l=0, count=0, res=0;
        for(int r=0; r<nums.size(); r++){
            if(nums[r] == 0) count++;
            if(count>1){
                while(count>1){
                    if(nums[l] == 0) count--;
                    l++;
                }
            }
            res = max(res, r-l+1-count);
        }
        return (res==nums.size()) ? res-1 : res;
    }
};
```
