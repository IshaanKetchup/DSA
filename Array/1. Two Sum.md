## [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

This solution beats 100%
Unordered map creates a Python dictionary-like data structure, where you have key-value pairs.
Here, key is set as `nums[i]`, and the value is the index `i`
However, adding the element to the map is done AFTER checking if the complement exists. This is done so as to reduce the number of elements added to the map
So once the code confirms that there is no complement in the current keys, it adds it to the map.
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int,int> map;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.count(complement) && map[complement] != i) {
                return {i, map[complement]};
            }
            map[nums[i]] = i;
        }
        return {};
    }
};


```
Always remember, when trying to get 100%, try reducing the number of computations, or trying to 'localize' the computations instead.
