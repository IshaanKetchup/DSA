## [62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)
### Recursive solution
Doesnt work 100% due to TLE
Fix: memoization!
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int helper(int &m, int &n, int i, int j){
        if(i==m-1 && j== n-1) return 1;
        if(i>=m || j>=n) return 0;
        int right = helper(m, n, i+1, j);
        int down = helper(m, n, i, j+1);
        return right+down;
    }
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        return helper(m,n,0,0);
    }
};
```

### Memoization
Still giving TLE - apparently because of the function definition - `vector<vector<int>> dp` makes it copy dp every call
This destroys the point of memoization
FIX: Pass by reference, not by value `vector<vector<int>> &dp`
Even when you passed dp by value, the program worked functionally (correct outputs) â€” because each recursive call had its own local copy of the DP table, and each copy worked independently. But this behavior does not mean the original dp was being modified or reused.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int helper(int &m, int &n, int i, int j, vector<vector<int>> dp){
        if(i==m-1 && j== n-1) return 1;
        if(i>=m || j>=n) return 0;
        if (dp[i][j] != -1) return dp[i][j];
        int right = helper(m, n, i, j+1, dp);
        int down = helper(m, n, i+1, j, dp);
        return dp[i][j] = right+down;
    }
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>>dp (m, vector<int>(n,-1));
        return helper(m,n,0,0, dp);
    }
};
```
