## [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

O(n) complexity
Iterate through the Linked List, do successive reversing of each node in place.
1. Save the next value of Current node (curr) before breaking link (next=curr.next)
2. Change next value of current node to PREVIOUS value in list
3. Move Previous pointer forward
4. Mode current pointer forward


```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null, curr = head, next = null;
        while (curr != null) {
            next = curr.next;  
            curr.next = prev;  
            prev = curr;       
            curr = next;       
        }
        return prev;  
    }        
    
}
```
