## [24. Swap Nodes in Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/)

Easy peasy logic, 3 pointers needed, one for current node, one for previous node and one for next node
this is to facilitate in place swapping of pairs.
-   **`prev`**: Keeps track of the node before the current pair (this helps for linking the swapped pair back into the list).
-   **`curr`**: Points to the first node in the current pair.
-   **`n`**: Points to the second node in the current pair.
To swap, you need to do:
- `curr.next = n.next`
- `n.next = curr`
- `prev.next = n`
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
        // Base case: list is empty or has only one node
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;

        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head; // Start with dummy pointing to the original head
        
        ListNode prev = dummy; // prev points to dummy initially
        ListNode curr = head;  // curr points to the first node
        ListNode n = head.next; // n points to the second node
        
        while (curr != null && curr.next != null) {
            curr.next = n.next;
            n.next = curr;
            prev.next = n;

            prev = curr;
            curr = curr.next;
            if (curr != null) {
                n = curr.next; 
            }
        }

        return dummy.next;
    }
}

```
