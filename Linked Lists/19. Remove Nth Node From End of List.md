## [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

Find the total number of elements in LL by iterating through it, and from that calculate target as `length-n`
Iterate for loop, from 0 to `length - n`, so as to stop short of the nth element.
Then, skip element by doing `temp.next = temp.next.next`
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;

        int length = 0;
        ListNode temp = head;
        while (temp != null) {
            length++;
            temp = temp.next;
        }

        temp = dummy;
        for (int i = 0; i < length - n; i++) {
            temp = temp.next;
        }

        temp.next = temp.next.next;

        return dummy.next;
    }
}

```
