## [29. Divide Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-two-integers/)

you HAVE to use BITWISE operations for this :(
- Basic idea is that if `a = 43` and `b = temp = 3` then you want to multiply `temp` with powers of 2 until it exceeds `a = 43`, which means `3 * 16 = 48` is where it exceeds
so a while loop for this: `while (a >= (temp<<1))` meaning while `a >= temp*2 `
- We also keep track of the power of 2 using `multiple`, which is multiplied by 2 each round using `multiple <<=1`


Basically, 
| Step | a (Remaining) | temp Used (3×n) | res (Accumulated) |
|------|----------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 1    | 43 → 19        | 24 (3×8)         | 8                  |
| 2    | 19 → 7         | 12 (3×4)         | 12                 |
| 3    | 7 → 1          | 6 (3×2)          | 14                 |

It mimics Long Division by subtracting the LARGEST CHUNK (multiple of divisor, power of 2) each time.
So it divides 43 into 8x3 parts, which results in remainder 19
19 is divided into 4x3 parts, which results in remainder 7
7 is divided into 2x3 parts, which results in remainder 1. Here, `a (1) < (temp<<1)`  so it stops.
The powers of two are all added to res -> indicative of how many parts it has been split into! 8+3+4 = 14. And 14 x 3 = 42. 
Finally, the sign of the result is calculated using XOR -> if ONLY ONE from `divisor` or `dividend` is less than zero, result is negative of what we've calculated!
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
        // Handle overflow edge case
        if (dividend == INT_MIN && divisor == -1) return INT_MAX;
        long long a = abs((long long)dividend);
        long long b = abs((long long)divisor);
        long long res = 0;

        while(a>=b){
            long long temp = b, multiple = 1;
            while(a>=(temp<<1)){
                temp <<=1;
                multiple <<=1;
            }
            a -= temp;
            res += multiple;
        }
        return (dividend<0 ^ divisor<0)? -res : res;
    }
};

```
