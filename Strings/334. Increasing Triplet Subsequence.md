## [334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/)

O(n) complexity
Without using division

Solving this question and beating 100% of Runtimes is NOT something that is necessary - apparently it has something to do with LeetCodes runtimes being inconsistent. However, do note that for `vector` it is definitely faster to use `auto num: nums` over iteration, or `int num: nums`
Getting a 100% runtime was a dumb luck. Most people on LeetCode have 2-3ms runtimes, simply because they didn't use `auto`

Steps:
1. Initialize `a` and `b` to `INT_MAX`
2. Iterate through array. 
	* If an element is smaller than `a`, update the value of `a` to element value.
	* If an element is bigger than `a` but smaller than `b`, update `b`.
	* If an element is still bigger than `b`, then we have our triplet

The logic for this is far from intuitive, and the output is far from 100% correct, as this solution does *NOT* maintain the correct indices for i, j, k. 
For example: 
for `nums = [20,100,10,12,5,13]`
This returns true for the triplet `12, 5, 13`

However, the logic of the code *is* sound, and it identifies correct triplets implicitly rather than explicitly - in step 2. a, ( If an element is smaller than `a`, update the value of `a` to element value.), this makes the value of `a` update to 5, while `b` remains 12. This results in incorrect triplet identification, but it is also implied that for `b = 12`, there must have been a smaller value of `b` before  `b` became 12 (Step 2.b)


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool increasingTriplet(vector<int>& nums) {
        int a = INT_MAX, b = INT_MAX;
        for (auto num: nums) {
            if (num <= a) a = num;
            else if (num <= b) b = num;
            else return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
