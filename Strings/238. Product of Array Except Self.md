## [238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

O(n) complexity
Without using division

Note that this is a simple question, and more than a solving the test cases, the aim is to do so in an extremely efficient manner - minimizing time and space complexity

Steps:
1. Iterate through the array, and create `output` which contains the product of all elements to the left of a specific element. For first element, the product will be 1
2. Iterate through array in reverse, and multiply every element `output[i]` with the right product. Update right product. For first iteration, right product = 1 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> output(n);

        output[0] = 1;
        
        for(int i = 1; i<n; i++){
            output[i] = output[i-1]*nums[i-1];
        }
        int right = 1;
        for(int i = n-1; i>=0; i--){
            output[i]*=right;
            right*=nums[i];
        }
        return output;
    }
};
```
